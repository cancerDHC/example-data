  Title: GDC Specimen Example - Sept 2021 F2F Demonstrator 1
  Schema: ccdh.0713cc.Specimen
  Description:
    - "CRDC-H-compliant representation of the 'aggregate' GDC source data example described here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14lWLDD7iyJG0G57m6BgWYIeqrxK04P3qQRwxziqEz1A/edit#gid=0"
    - "**FOR EASIEST VIEWING TURN WORD WRAP OFF SO THAT COMMENTS DON'T RUN ONTO A NEW LINE**"
    - "In this example enumerated values are captured using a CodeableConcept object which bundles one or more Coding objects, each holding a single concept code and supporting metadata."

  Example:                                                        # type = Specimen

    identifier:                                                   # type = Identifier   (Identifier is a complex data type, but we are only showing a single field from this type)
      - value: "target:TARGET-40-0A4I9I-01A"                      # GDC.Sample.sample_submitter_id (specified here as a CURIE, where the prefix indicates the system that assigned it)

    Description:
      - "This is a minimal example showing only id and identifiers.  For a richer Project record, see the examples in Demonstrator 2."
    Example:                                                        # type = ResearchProject
        id: "f2f:bc65592e-c7e2-5ab5-3c56-283ea2efc8f8"              # Local uuid assigned by this system for the Research Project
        identifier:                                                 # type = Identifier
          - value: "gdc-project:TARGET-OS"                          # GDC.Sample.project_id
          - value: "crdc:pj1000004"                                 # Proposed globally unique identifier per recommendation of the CRDC-DST
        research_project_type: Project                              # Note also that because the CRDC-H collapses GDC.Program and GDC.Project into a single type called 'ResearchProject', the ResearchProject.research_project_type field is used to indicate which specific type this instance represents.
